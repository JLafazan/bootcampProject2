Premise

We originally had three ideas - an app that recorded peopleâ€™s stories and experiences; an app that enabled people in Sacramento to engage and participate in events; and an app that organized multiple social media channels privately. After consulting with Jordan and Treighton, we filtered and refined our ideas into an app that would encourage a close-knit community in Sacramento by allowing users and businesses to share their upcoming events and experiences only local to the city of Sacramento.

Technologies involved

This full-stack app includes:
HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, Handlebars.js, testing frameworks/assertion libraries (Mocha, Chai, Nightmare.js), routing, servers, MVC paradigm, CRUD

Deployed using Heroku

Version control using Git

Tokenization?
