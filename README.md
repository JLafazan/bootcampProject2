Sacramento People, Places, and Fun Events

1) Home Page - Log In, Video Introduction, Links to pages
2) Event Blog - Story and Picture Database
3) Places and Events In Sacramento - Search Engine/ Database
4) Media Page - Search and store favorite media links

Premise

We originally had three ideas - an app that recorded peopleâ€™s stories and experiences; an app that enabled people in Sacramento to engage and participate in events; and an app that organized multiple social media channels privately. After consulting with Jordan and Treighton, we filtered and refined our ideas into an app that would encourage a close-knit community in Sacramento by allowing users and businesses to share their upcoming events and experiences only local to the city of Sacramento.

Technologies involved

This full-stack app includes:
HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, Handlebars.js, testing frameworks/assertion libraries (Mocha, Chai, Nightmare.js), routing, servers, MVC paradigm, CRUD

Deployed using Heroku

Version control using Git

Tokenization?

Updates to bootcampproject2

Saturday, may 5, 2018

1 consulted with nelly on our project
2 discussed differences b/w paid vs free version, public vs private version
3 incentives for signing up - 

public version allows you to just go to the events (cost of event depends on the organizers and vendors' discretion) and 
	
private version allows you to create travelog or scrapbook with photos, memories, experience at the event, meeting people, and allows you to have private entries that YOU share with people YOU choose and feel comfortable with seeing without fear of exposing your private life to other strangers and ppl you don't like

1) Received guidance from Nelly in making the user's saved events the same as the events shown on the events page

2) Troubleshooted through files we couldn't find, databases and tables we couldn't make, repos we couldn't pull, and branches that couldn't work (it's OK, we dealt with it all)

3) Decided on making three databases - users, user's favorites, events

TO DO!!!

TO DO:

Shaughn: databases: events_db, users_db, favorites_db

sequelize the &5?! out of it!

UNDER EVENTS DB:
id, name, location, image, date, description

USERS DB:
id, name, password (blank for privacy)

FAVORITES DB:
id, event id, user id

2) michelle: use handlebars to create the grid made to organize dummy organizations, make dummy pages for the 'about us' pages, work on handlebars for these pages

3) someone: create ORM 
_________

EXTRA TASKS FOR ALL:
1) new technology: web scraping - get the page's data and put it to the ORM
